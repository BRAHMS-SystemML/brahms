% This is not a function, it is just here so that Matlab's
% intellisense offers "sml_system" from the key "sml" (the
% intellisense doesn't recognise the class "sml_system", it seems).
% Matlab's scoping/precedence rules in "doc function" make it clear
% that this correct behaviour when actually calling "sml_system" is
% to use the class, so no problem there. In addition, this file does
% not seem to impact on the help system. So it's purely for
% intellisense's sake.
