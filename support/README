MAKEFILE.RELEASE
------------------------------------------------------------

Many examples and templates are given that include a
makefile to compile a source file to a brahms binary
component. All of these include the file "makefile.release"
at the top (this makefile is used when building BRAHMS to
keep as many settings as possible in one place). For
example, the makefile in this folder includes it at the top.

This makefile may change in future releases, so it is
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you make a copy of it when you
copy templates or examples to form the beginnings of your
own components. That way, if this file does change in a
future release, your own builds will not be affected.
