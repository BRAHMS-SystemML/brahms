ONLINE
---------------------------

The BRAHMS documenation is available online at

http://brahms.sourceforge.net/docs





OFFLINE
---------------------------

This folder is a placeholder for the offline documentation.
It is not included with the release, but if you want, you
can visit the online docs above, where you will find a link
to download the latest documentation. Unzip the file you
download to this folder, and then BRAHMS will be able to
find and open the local documentation when required.
