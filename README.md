# BRAHMS

BRAHMS is a simulation execution engine which was written by Ben Michinson. 
It's often used alongside SpineML/SpineML_2_BRAHMS to provide a simulation 
back-end for SpineML/SpineCreator. The original author is not currently 
developing BRAHMS, although it is in current use within the Adaptive
Behaviour Research Group and is expected to carry on being used there.

This is a fork of the Brahms simulator starting from brahms version 0.7.3.

The key improvement is a sensible build system to replace the custom makefiles
in the original, because at present we are using "set in aspic" binary builds
of BRAHMS and we would like to be able to easily modify and add features to
BRAHMS as we see fit.
